\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in American English is without an ``e'' after the ``g.''
Use the singular heading even if you have many acknowledgments. Avoid expressions such as ``One of us (S.B.A.) would like to thank ... .''
Instead, write ``F. A. Author thanks ... .'' In most cases, sponsor and financial support acknowledgments are placed in the unnumbered footnote on the first page, not here.
